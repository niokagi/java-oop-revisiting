# Revisiting Java OOP Concepts & Practice

A repository for personal notes and code implementations focused on revisiting and applying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Java.


## Core OOP Principles

This repository explores the four fundamental principles of OOP, with practical code examples for each.

-   **Encapsulation**: Bundling data and methods into a single unit (class) while hiding the internal state.
-   **Inheritance**: Allowing new classes to inherit properties and methods from existing classes.
-   **Polymorphism**: Enabling objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in unique ways.
-   **Abstraction**: Hiding complex implementation details by exposing only essential functionalities, often through abstract classes and interfaces.


## About This Repository

This repository serves as a personal reference and a practical log of my journey in applying OOP concepts with Java. The code is focused on clarity and illustrating the principles discussed.
